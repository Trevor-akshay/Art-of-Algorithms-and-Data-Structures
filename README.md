CR - Coding round

TR - Technical round

DSA - Data structures and Algorithms

DS - Data strucures

A - Algorithms

#MUST KNOW : 

                  So you preparing for CR / TR then you gotta have good skills in data structures and their properites.

                  Well actually not just their properties but also their internal working and how to create them.
          
                  You should have good knowledge of how and when to use a DS / A in your solution for optimisation.
                  
                  DS : 
                        1 . Arrays
                        2 . List
                        3 . Stack
                        4 . Queue
                        5 . Tree
                        6 . Graph
                        7 . Map / HashTable
                        8 . Set
                        9 . Heap / PriorityQueue
                        10 . N-ary trees (Tries / Prefix-Tree)
                        11 . Search trees (BST and Red Black Tree / AVL)
                  
                 
#TIPS :

                  Cant think of an optimal solution ? give the brute force solution coz a working solution is better than no solution
                  
                  While you code always interact with your interviewer but why? This is not to make him understand your code or your logic but HE/SHE understand you know the logic and  not just memorised it
                  
                  Ask N number of questions to clarify your doubts and in the mean time always think on how to process with an optimal solution
                  
                  Code / Explain a solution ASAP and remember to use readalbe/meaningful varible names
                  
                  If your stuck the interviewer might throw hints , try to grab and move on but never openly ask for hints unless you have no idea how to procede with the question
